I decided to apply the hover effect to the product in the products page using this link:http://www.webdesignermag.co.uk/tutorials/apply-hover-effects-and-images-to-images-and-divs/

This technique utilizes a combination of JQuery and javascript plug-in to create the hover effect.
I downloaded the contentHover.js plug in from the source page and include it into the products.php page.
I then wrote a javascript that would utilize the contenthover function within contentHover.js and customize for the fading effect.
The images with hover effect all have the class as d1 and <div class="contenthover"> displays the content of the hover effect.
There is also additional styling for the contenthover to have the right formatting.

This tutorial doesn't work very well with the products page because the styling was awful.
However, the source page for the plug-in has a very detailed explanation of the code and several styles of fading to choose from.
